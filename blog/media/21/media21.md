**Spoilers:** In most, if not all of the Christopher Nolan films.

We're listing the "mind-bender" Christopher Nolan films from least to most confusing. That means I won't include the Dark Knight Series or Dunkirk.

## 5. The Prestige (2006)

This movie makes the most sense. Whether it be due to them saying most of the exposition in the end, or that

The science fiction twist is a bit shocking but in a fictional movie isn't the most outlandish thing. (and it is by far the least confusing thing among the movies on this list)

The ending leaves most questions the audience has answered and lends its hand to multiple viewings because you notice duplicitous nuances throughout the film you missed on the first time watching.

Is this my favourite Christopher Nolan film of all time? Yes.

## 4.  Memento (2000)

This movie follows a non-linear plot structure with the coloured sequences moving in reverse and the black and white sequences moving forward.

This movie is confusing for a multitude of reasons, firstly the fact that the story is moving backwards, Teddy is killed in the first scene and then because it moves backwards he is alive everywhere else. Secondly you are only given as much context as the scene allows. Everything is framed to a timeframe that is (purposely) inconvenient for the viewer. Your first reference point for Teddy is "Don't believe his lies". We know that only at the end of the movie Leonard puts that there after he exposes he killed the real "John G" ages ago, but he forgot.

The "Sammy Jankis" story moving forward interweaved with the colour story is confusing in its own right

## 3. Interstellar


## 2. Inception (2010)

Inception was heralded at its release for the grand visuals and linear but complex story. My boldest take is that it hasn't age well 10 years later where CGI has all but dwarfed the whimsical scenes elaborately created for dreams. I still like Inception but I find it is the 

Interstellar

## 1. Tenet (2020)

Yes. This movie is confusing. Let's first look at how much exposition is needed to set up the premise. From early trailers **we knew** it was going to involve going forwards and backwards in time. That is scratching the surface of the complexity of the movie.
